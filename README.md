# CMSI 186 Lab 1 Movie Mixup Starter Code

This repository contains an incomplete, wrong, and very mixed up tree of movies and their genres and actors. It also contains some posers who actually aren’t in any movies.

Import this repository into a new repository of your own and clean the data, and add new data of your own, according to the lab [instructions](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/classes/plab/lab/1/). This is a command line exercise, so remember to keep track of the commands you used to fix things up.

Don’t forget to also update this README file in your new repository!
